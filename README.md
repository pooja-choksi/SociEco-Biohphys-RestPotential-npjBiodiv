# Land-Tenure-Restoration-Potential
Globally, ecological restoration could help achieve critical carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation goals. To assist the process of situating large-scale restoration, several studies have mapped global restoration priority or opportunity areas based on biophysical factors. We propose that human development needs and land tenure are critical considerations for assessing restoration potential and for successful long-term restoration. Using India, which has high biophysical restoration potential and a large restoration target of 26 million hectares to be restored by 2030, as a case study, we demonstrate a framework to quantify restoration potential based on land tenure and socio-economic and climatic vulnerability of people. To do so, we use public land use data to map land tenure across the country and quantify ownership of land in high restoration potential areas according to previous studies based on biophysical factors. Further, we present three scenarios to demonstrate the how restoration can help target specific land tenures in order to reach (1) the maximum population, (2) the most socio-economically vulnerable populations (based on MPI) and (3) the most climatically vulnerable (based on data from CEEW). This study provides an example of how to plan restoration across the country to realistically meet time-sensitive targets and human development goals by accounting for land tenure.
